        <h1>Few words about myself</h1>
        <p>My name is <i><b>Sohrab</b></i> and I love to work with 
        <b>Computers</b>, sometimes I feel I am not that 
        good with these machines; however, I still 
        enjoy working with them. During a working
        day, I spend 8 to 10 hours in front of computers 
        because of my job which is IT.</p>
        <p>I started the IT job since Feb 22<sup>th</sup>2005 in my 
        company FCI Lender Services, Inc.<br/> When I 
        started it I did not know that much about 
        computers, but I start educating myself 
        in the same time as working, so I learned 
        a lot. Now I ca manage the network, create 
        and administrate the servers, work with 
        cloud and virtual machines, and manage our webservers.</p>
        <p>Recently I notice that I enjoy writing 
        programs and see that my program works, 
        that is why I thought I should start 
        leering programing languages. Therefore, 
        I start my college focusing on computer 
        since and programing. So far, I got few 
        classes that interfused me to several 
        languages like Java, and C++.</p>
        <p>Beside computers I like to bike, 
        sometimes during the weekend I drive 
        to mountain and over there I do the mountain 
        biking.my other favorite sport is volleyball; 
        whenever I do have time I go to gym and play volleyball there. </p>
