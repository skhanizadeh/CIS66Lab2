        <h1>Few words about <s>My Life</s> Myself</h1>
        <p>My name is <i><b>Sohrab</b></i> and I love to work with 
        <b>Computers</b>, sometimes I feel I am not that 
        good with these machines; however, I still 
        enjoy working with them. During a working
        day, I spend 8 to 10 hours in front of computers 
        because of my job which is <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>.</p>
        <p>I started the IT job since Feb 22<sup>th</sup>2005 in my 
        company FCI Lender Services, Inc.<br/> When I 
        started it I did not know that much about 
        computers, but I start educating myself 
        in the same time as working, so I learned 
        a lot. Now I ca manage the network, create 
        and administrate the servers, work with 
        cloud and virtual machines, and manage our webservers.</p>
        <p>Recently I notice that I enjoy writing 
        programs and see that my program works, 
        that is why I thought I should start 
        leering programing languages. Therefore, 
        I start my college focusing on <strong>computer 
        since</strong> and <em>programing</em>. So far, I got few 
        classes that interfused me to several 
        languages like <u>Java</u>, and <u>C++</u>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Beside computers I like to bike, 
        sometimes during the weekend I drive 
        to mountain and over there I do the mountain 
        biking.<blockquote. cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking"> Mountain 
		biking is the sport of riding bicycles off-road, 
		often over rough terrain, using specially designed 
		mountain bikes.</blockquote>my other favorite sport is volleyball; 
        whenever I do have time I go to gym and play volleyball there. In
		Addition I like to play <dfn>Setar</dfn>, which is a Persian musical instrument</p>
